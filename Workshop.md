## Consensual Non-Consent (CNC) workshop

Presented by Mia, this workshop is designed to transfer skills I have learnt in my many years (and scenes) within the melbourne kink community.

It will focus on CNC play, but will cover a much broader base of topics associated with kink-play in general.

I want to explore how CNC is a wonderful gateway to fun, intense and hilarious scenes, and to being able to push the limits of both tops and bottoms through the unique headspace that CNC gives to its participants.

The Workshop has 3 main elements:

1) Several informational sessions
2) Practical scene examples
3) A deep dive into essential skillsets

## Information session

This will cover the following points:

* Exploring consent within CNC contexts
* Exploring the mindset of "why" you want to do CNC
* Exploring the practical nuances of this type of play

## 4 essential skillsets

The Idea Matrices

> Building a brain-aid for systemic scene planning.

Designing flowcharts for scene flow

> Using a flowchart to chart out a scene for maximum flow, best consent practices, and to discover any "problem points" in a scene.

How to improvise and troubleshoot mid scene without stopping the flow

>Looking at impact play, degradation play, sex play, bondage play, and how to problem solve the issues that are most likely to arise.

Communication strategies for negotiations and debriefs

>How to negotiate effectively and avoid common communication pitfalls, so the negotiations are exciting and effective, and how to mine the post-scene discussions to learn how to make future scenes better.

## Scene examples to highlight different styles of play

* Rubix cube scene - Humour
* Bladder play scene - Degradation
* Dictionary scene - Getting into someones head
* Rubber band scene - Plot Twists!

# About the Presenter

I have been in the kink scene for 6+ years and have done over 50 scenes in public spaces (  The Club, Prov, Pleasure Palace, Splinter, Spirit Kink, Curiosity ) and *many* more in private.

I am a sadomasochistic switch, and have experience on both sides of the d/s slash, I have a cert IV in training and assessment, and have done private studies in psychology, and I've ready a bunch of books on kink, I also help run the northern munch.

Joining me will be a partner, Electric Crystal, who will be assisting with scene examples, and providing insight into her experience as a play partner.
